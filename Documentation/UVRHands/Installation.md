# Installation
To setup the project, place the following Plugins into the Plugins folder of the Project(the plugins folder of the engines main installation should also work but is not tested.)

- USemLog
- UVRHands
- Manus
- UCutting-main (is WIP to be integrated and should be optional)

Install all other necessary plugins and build the project as described in the main documentation.

TODO More installation steps?

Now you should be able to start RobCog in the Unreal environment.
